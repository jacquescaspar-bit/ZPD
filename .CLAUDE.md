# Coding Rules

## Mandatory Quality Checks

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST run these commands after completing ANY code changes and BEFORE marking any task as complete:

1. Run `pnpm run typecheck` (or `npx tsc --noEmit`) - to catch TypeScript errors
2. Run `pnpm run lint` - to catch linting issues

If either command fails, you must fix the issues before considering the work done.

## Git

- Do not make any git commits for me. Do not ever push anything for me.

## Styles

- Clickable elements need to have the "pointer" css style applied to them.

## Renaming

- When renaming things, be sure to also rename related files and variables

## React

- Avoid large components. One component per task.
- Files in components/ui should be dumb components that do not import the store
- Stop creating custom <button> components. Use components/ui/button
- Use classNames class instead of trying to build up css class names with ternary logic

## Eslint

- Do not ignore eslint rules without first explicitly confirming with me first. E.g. // eslint-disable-next-line max-lines-per-function
