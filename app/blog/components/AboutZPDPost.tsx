      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        When people ask me what ZPD Learning is about, I don't start with
        tutoring techniques or test scores. I start with a simple truth: Most
        kids are capable of so much more than schools currently help them
        achieve. The system wasn't built for individual learners – it was built
        for groups. And that's where we come in.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        We're not just another tutoring service. We're a mission-driven company
        that believes every child deserves education that fits them perfectly.
        Here's our story and why it matters.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        How We Got Started
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Our founders were educators who kept seeing the same frustrating
        pattern: brilliant kids who struggled in traditional classrooms, not
        because they weren't smart, but because the teaching didn't match how
        they learnt. They knew about the Zone of Proximal Development from their
        training, but they saw how rarely it was actually applied in real
        schools.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        So they started small – working with individual students, applying ZPD
        principles one-on-one. The results were incredible. Kids who had been
        struggling suddenly thrived. Kids who had been bored suddenly engaged.
        That's when we knew we were onto something big.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        What Makes Us Different
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        In a world full of tutoring options, what sets us apart? It's not fancy
        technology or expensive materials. It's our unwavering commitment to
        personalisation. We don't have a "method" that we apply to everyone. We
        have a philosophy that guides us to meet each student exactly where they
        are.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Every aspect of what we do – from tutor matching to progress tracking to
        parent communication – is designed around the individual. Because we
        believe that when education fits the person, amazing things happen.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        Our People Are Everything
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        ZPD Learning runs on the talent and dedication of our team. Our tutors
        aren't just subject experts – they're certified educators trained in
        child development, learning theory, and relationship-building. Our
        support staff are former teachers and counselors who understand the
        challenges families face.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        But more than credentials, our team shares a passion for education and a
        belief in every child's potential. They're the ones who make the
        difference every day.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        Evidence-Based, Heart-Driven
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        We combine rigorous research with genuine care for students. Every
        approach we use is backed by studies, but we never forget that behind
        the data are real kids with real feelings. Our evidence-based methods
        create the structure, but our caring relationships make the learning
        stick.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        This balance is our secret sauce – head and heart working together for
        extraordinary results.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        Accessibility and Equity
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Quality education shouldn't be a luxury. We work hard to make our
        services accessible through flexible pricing, scholarships, and online
        options. We serve students from all backgrounds, abilities, and
        circumstances because we believe talent and potential aren't distributed
        by zip code or family income.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        When we say "every child," we mean every child – regardless of their
        starting point or challenges.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        Our Impact in Numbers
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Don't just take our word for it. Our students see average grade
        improvements of 1.5 levels within six months. 85% report increased
        academic confidence. We have 95% parent satisfaction and high retention
        rates because families see real, lasting change.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        But the real impact isn't in the numbers – it's in the kids who discover
        they love learning, the parents who feel empowered to support their
        children, and the futures that open up because someone believed in their
        potential.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        Continuous Innovation
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Education evolves, and so do we. We're constantly researching new
        approaches, incorporating technology thoughtfully, and learning from our
        experiences. What worked five years ago might not be optimal today, so
        we stay curious and adaptable.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        This commitment to growth ensures we always provide the best possible
        education for our students.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        Our Vision for the Future
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        We dream of a world where personalised education isn't exceptional –
        it's standard. Where every child gets teaching that matches how they
        learn, when they learn best, and at the pace that's right for them.
        We're working toward that future, one student at a time.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Along the way, we're partnering with schools, training other educators,
        and advocating for systemic change. Because great tutoring is wonderful,
        but great education for all would be revolutionary.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
        Why We Do This
      </h3>
      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        At the end of the day, ZPD Learning exists because we believe in human
        potential. We've seen too many kids dismissed as "not academic" or "slow
        learners" who just needed the right approach to unlock their abilities.
        We've watched "problem students" become engaged learners when someone
        finally understood how they ticked.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Every child has a right to education that helps them discover who they
        can be. That's not just our mission – it's our calling. And we're just
        getting started.
      </p>
